// When starting Android emulator, make sure you have enabled Wipe user data.
// If you are using Android Virtual Devices (AVD), ensure that Use Host GPU is checked in the settings for your virtual device.
// If using an emulator and the only thing that shows up on the screen is the message: [APPNAME] won't run without Google Play services which are not supported by your device., you need to change the emulator CPU/ABI setting to a system image that includes Google APIs. These may need to be downloaded from the Android SDK Manager first.
